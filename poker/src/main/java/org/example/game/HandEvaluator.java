    //hand types:
    /*
Strongest to weakest hands:

Royal Flush
A-K-Q-J-10, all the same suit. (e.g., A♠ K♠ Q♠ J♠ 10♠)
→ unbeatable, the absolute nuts.
Straight Flush
Five cards in sequence, all the same suit. (e.g., 7♥ 6♥ 5♥ 4♥ 3♥)
Four of a Kind (Quads)
Four cards of the same rank. (e.g., 9♣ 9♦ 9♥ 9♠ + 2♣)
Full House
Three of a kind + a pair. (e.g., K♠ K♦ K♥ + 8♣ 8♦)
Flush
Five cards of the same suit, not in sequence. (e.g., A♦ J♦ 9♦ 5♦ 2♦)
Straight
Five cards in sequence, any suits. (e.g., 10♠ 9♥ 8♦ 7♣ 6♣)
Note: Ace can be high (A-K-Q-J-10) or low (5-4-3-2-A).
Three of a Kind (Trips/Set)
Three cards of the same rank. (e.g., 5♠ 5♦ 5♣ + 10♠ Q♦)
Two Pair
Two pairs of different ranks. (e.g., J♠ J♦ + 4♣ 4♥ + 9♦)
One Pair
Two cards of the same rank. (e.g., Q♠ Q♥ + 7♦ 5♣ 2♠)
High Card
None of the above — your hand is judged by the highest card. (e.g., A♠ 10♦ 7♥ 4♣ 2♠ is “Ace-high”)
